You can  check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2836860/The_Horror_at_Highrook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p id="fb44" data-selectable-paragraph="">Hello internet! This is a short post to introduce my new game, explain how it came to be and what to expect from it. First a bit of history….</p><p id="2e5d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph aec aed ys aee b aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rq aen aeo aep sy aeq aer aes tc aet aeu aev aew lv cn" data-selectable-paragraph="">Across most of 2022 I had been working on a deep turn based tactics game called Void Warden, I was coming out of a publishing deal with Humble Games and at the time the market seemed fairly stable. Void Warden was an attempt to upscale my ambitions, studio size and reach. I was really happy with the progress I was making with the game and decided to announce the project and seek publisher funding in the spring of 2023. If you have been following any videogame business news over the last year or so you will quickly realise that this was not a great time to start looking for money.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://tomnullpointer.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/21/1_EAu3AJfW8XpWb64DoMNeDQ.webp" alt="" width="460" height="215" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://tomnullpointer.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/21/responsive/1_EAu3AJfW8XpWb64DoMNeDQ-xs.webp 320w, https://tomnullpointer.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/21/responsive/1_EAu3AJfW8XpWb64DoMNeDQ-sm.webp 480w, https://tomnullpointer.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/21/responsive/1_EAu3AJfW8XpWb64DoMNeDQ-md.webp 768w, https://tomnullpointer.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/21/responsive/1_EAu3AJfW8XpWb64DoMNeDQ-xl.webp 1024w"></figure><p id="ca30" class="pw-post-body-paragraph aec aed ys aee b aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rq aen aeo aep sy aeq aer aes tc aet aeu aev aew lv cn" data-selectable-paragraph="">I spent close to six months in what felt like endless rounds of pitches, negotiations, planning, form-filling. What seemed like tortuous indecision form many publishers I now know was just a reflection of their own internal funding problems. Money was being pulled out of the industry all through 2023 (and still is). This meant that deals were getting harder and harder to find, and some of the ones I did get offered had such bad terms attached that it didn't make sense to pursue them.</p><p id="94c8" class="pw-post-body-paragraph aec aed ys aee b aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rq aen aeo aep sy aeq aer aes tc aet aeu aev aew lv cn" data-selectable-paragraph="">In several cases the negotiations went right up to the point of signing, but then the publisher would drop out. I don’t blame any of these parties for what was happening, and In deed I feel sympathetic for some of these publishers who were trying to keep their own boats afloat in a tricky climate. However, it all resulted in what felt like a massive waste of time for me. I’d slowed down development in order to pitch and negotiate, and I’d even re-targeted the game several times to suit some interesting opportunities. At the end of the summer of 23 it was clear that I would have to change my approach. I am sure I would get funding for the tactics game eventually, but I had no idea how long it would take and the constant grind was wearing on my mental health.</p><p id="6cf7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph aec aed ys aee b aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rq aen aeo aep sy aeq aer aes tc aet aeu aev aew lv cn" data-selectable-paragraph="">Instead I decided to take a break and look at some of the other prototypes I had on the back-burner. One of those projects was an odd narrative card game inspired by the likes of Cultist Simulator, Strange Horticulture and Citizen Sleeper.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://tomnullpointer.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/21/1_o1lskk71e7xIgb3sbfaszA.webp" alt="" width="720" height="405" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://tomnullpointer.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/21/responsive/1_o1lskk71e7xIgb3sbfaszA-xs.webp 320w, https://tomnullpointer.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/21/responsive/1_o1lskk71e7xIgb3sbfaszA-sm.webp 480w, https://tomnullpointer.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/21/responsive/1_o1lskk71e7xIgb3sbfaszA-md.webp 768w, https://tomnullpointer.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/21/responsive/1_o1lskk71e7xIgb3sbfaszA-xl.webp 1024w"></figure><p id="caeb" class="pw-post-body-paragraph aec aed ys aee b aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rq aen aeo aep sy aeq aer aes tc aet aeu aev aew lv cn" data-selectable-paragraph="">My design for the Tactics game required hiring a few team members over at least a year of development and it was very unlikely that I would be able to complete the game without the funds to expand the team in that way. This new card game idea was something that I could potentially develop entirely solo, especially if I was smart with the scope and assets.</p><p id="1f05" class="pw-post-body-paragraph aec aed ys aee b aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rq aen aeo aep sy aeq aer aes tc aet aeu aev aew lv cn" data-selectable-paragraph="">So I pivoted to working on this design, I wasn't happy about benching a whole year of work, but I had very little choice, and I was excited about the card game. To begin with I tentatively pitched the idea to some publishers, but again the deals just weren't there (or were too bad) and I didn't want to get back into the fruitless cycle of pitching and searching, so I decided to commit to making the whole thing myself.</p><p id="e2be" class="pw-post-body-paragraph aec aed ys aee b aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rq aen aeo aep sy aeq aer aes tc aet aeu aev aew lv cn" data-selectable-paragraph="">The game transformed over the last 6 months of full time development into what is now “The Horror At Highrook”, an occult card crafting game inspired by cosmic horror literature. Its a lovecraftian rpg, delivered via the interactions of cards and statistics in a haunted house. Its a pretty unique game, which means its hard to explain, but also isn't really competing with anything. I’ve had to re-learn some of my art-school drawing skills in order to produce much of the character designs and I’ve had to flex my writing skills a lot more than normal, but I'm really proud of how the game is shaping up.</p><figure class="afu afv afw afx afy adw ado adp paragraph-image"><div class="ado adp apv"><figure class="n acz adx c"><source srcset="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*iMBZuP9HrlCrTtyJH_mZag.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*iMBZuP9HrlCrTtyJH_mZag.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/1*iMBZuP9HrlCrTtyJH_mZag.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*iMBZuP9HrlCrTtyJH_mZag.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*iMBZuP9HrlCrTtyJH_mZag.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*iMBZuP9HrlCrTtyJH_mZag.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1280/format:webp/1*iMBZuP9HrlCrTtyJH_mZag.png 1280w" sizes="(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 640px" type="image/webp"><source data-testid="og" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*iMBZuP9HrlCrTtyJH_mZag.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/1*iMBZuP9HrlCrTtyJH_mZag.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*iMBZuP9HrlCrTtyJH_mZag.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/1*iMBZuP9HrlCrTtyJH_mZag.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/1*iMBZuP9HrlCrTtyJH_mZag.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/1*iMBZuP9HrlCrTtyJH_mZag.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1280/1*iMBZuP9HrlCrTtyJH_mZag.png 1280w" sizes="(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 640px"><img role="presentation" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*iMBZuP9HrlCrTtyJH_mZag.png" alt="" width="640" height="185" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></div></figure><p id="f803" class="pw-post-body-paragraph aec aed ys aee b aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rq aen aeo aep sy aeq aer aes tc aet aeu aev aew lv cn" data-selectable-paragraph="">So now its spring 2024 and even though the industry hasn't got back on its feet yet (2025 is when I’m told things will improve) I can’t sit back any longer. So as of today, the game has a Steam Page, a Newsletter, a trailer and all that jazz. Of course I am going to add more information and gameplay videos over time, there will even be a demo to play in the next few months. But for now please <strong class="aee hp">wishlist</strong> the game on steam, and spread the word. In times like these I appreciate all the help I can get to boost the games visibility. With luck and persistence perhaps the algorithmic gods will look kindly on my game, and I can live to code another day.</p><p id="e713" class="pw-post-body-paragraph aec aed ys aee b aef aeg aeh aei aej aek ael aem rq aen aeo aep sy aeq aer aes tc aet aeu aev aew lv cn" data-selectable-paragraph="">Check out the steam page (<strong class="aee hp">wishlist!</strong>) and the website below for more info/presskit/videos/newsletter and my discord</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on <time datetime="2025-10-05T19:20">Oct 5, 2025</time></div></footer></div></article></main><div class="right-bar"><div class="right-bar__inner"><div class="sidebar"><section class="box featured"><h3 class="box__title">Featured Posts</h3><ul class="featured__container"><li class="featured__item"><a href="https://tomnullpointer.github.io/gh-pages/about-me-post.html" class="featured__image"><img src="https://tomnullpointer.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/7/responsive/instapic-xs.png" loading="lazy" alt="" height="505" width="505"></a><div><a href="https://tomnullpointer.github.io/gh-pages/about-me-post.html" class="featured__title">About Me</a></div></li><li class="featured__item"><a href="https://tomnullpointer.github.io/gh-pages/about-my-academic-practice.html" class="featured__image"><img src="https://tomnullpointer.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/9/responsive/mexico1-md-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" height="513" width="513"></a><div><a href="https://tomnullpointer.github.io/gh-pages/about-my-academic-practice.html" class="featured__title">Academic Practice</a></div></li><li class="featured__item"><a href="https://tomnullpointer.github.io/gh-pages/cv-bio.html" class="featured__image"><img src="https://tomnullpointer.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/15/responsive/Bio-data-format-2-724x1024-3615278986-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" height="1024" width="1024"></a><div><a href="https://tomnullpointer.github.io/gh-pages/cv-bio.html" class="featured__title">C.V.
